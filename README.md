## Features

 - The user can share the pharmacy data to other apps like Twitter, Whatsapp...

## GPS mock

There are two ways to mock the phone location in case of not being inside of the region.


* Using a real device or an emulator with gapps:

  Go to Developer options -> [Select mock location app] (http://tamingthedroid.com/allow-mock-locations)

  Select an app installed on your phone that mocks locations. On Play Store there are some, for instance Mockation.
Install and open it. Set your desired location in Mockation(for this app to work it needs to be inside Extremadura-Spain-) and
run Farmaex app.

* Using the "geo" command in the emulator console: The first step is to get the desired location: https://itouchmap.com/latlong.html.
  Google maps also offers this functionality, just click on a place and the location will appear at the bottom. Also right clicking on a   place and pressing the 3rd option on the context menu will show latitud and longitud.
  After you send it from the command line to the emulator. Steps:

 1. Launch your application in the Android emulator and open a terminal/console in your SDK's /tools directory.
 2. Connect to the emulator console:
 
     ` telnet localhost <console-port> `
     
     Normally the console port use to be 5554. If this doesn't work you can get a list of connected devices
     with the following command: ` adb devices `. [Find emulator port](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32863647/android-emulator-  finding-port-number)
 3. Send the location data:
    This command accepts a longitude and latitude in decimal degrees. For example:
 
    ` geo fix 38.876135 -6.975236 `
